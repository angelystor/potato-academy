Some vulnerability research slides that I made to help our team get familiar with various bug classes.
This is by no means complete, but could be a good primer for people who are interested in bug hunting non web stuff.

Some of it is taken from the book, the Art of Software Security Assessment, which is a great book (although dated) to read.

The first pdf - audit strategies and bug classes, goes though a bit on how to audit software, and describes some bug classes such as
- off by 1
- arithmetic conversions
- type conversions 
- type confusions

The second pdf - hooking, goes through how to hook dynamically linked functions in C code in order to get them to do what you want >:E
